In the file, you will find 5 files:

-Season_scraper.py,
-QB_scraper.py,
-Season_data_eval.py,
-QB_data_miner.py, and
-QB_Score_Generator.py

To get the data you'll need, you must execute the files in that order. Just run them in a terminal with any python 3 command.
I'm still working on QB_Score_Genereator, so please bare with me.
